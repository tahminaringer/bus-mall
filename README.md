# Bus Mall

This project is a market analysis for a company similar to Sky Mall, designed to test their prospective customer interest. I used JavaScript to record votes for each product and store them in local storage in order to log votes per each user. I built a chart that shows how many times each product is shown and how many votes each product has received.
